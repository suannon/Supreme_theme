					<p>Many artists are tortured. Siegel is right that “the link between suffering and creativity seems less romantic than pragmatic.” Authentic creation that affects its audience requires a certain sensibility—a sensibility that often serves to amplify daily experience. Quotidian beauty feels, at times, breath-taking, unbearable; so does pain. <a href="#">The desperate desire for relief</a> from extreme experience, beautiful or painful, pushes many towards anesthetization. Bottles, needles, and pills promise numbness. Getting lost in the oblivion of a good high or a blackout starts to feel like necessity, the only viable option. This, I think, is what Siegel is getting at. </p>
					<p>The notion of an “arrangement with his demons” is <span class="highlight-blue">similarly misleading</span>. You can’t make a deal with addiction because addiction doesn’t play fair. The terms continuously change. Any relief found early on inevitably becomes elusive. The more you use, the more you have to use to get the job done. The sweet, innocent numbness of that first drunk or high becomes a lure, like the toy hare at a greyhound race, and addiction keeps you chasing until you drop. <a href="#" class="link-line">Any so-called “arrangement”</a> is executed under duress and denial, and is, for all intents and purposes, illegitimate.</p>
